# Machine learning
Solving some machine learning tasks:

1.1. K-nearest neighbors classifier for breast cancer dataset processing.
  1.2. K-nearest neighbors regressor for boston dataset processing.
2. Solve regression tasks with linear, lasso, ridge.
3. Machine learning methods with a teacher: decision trees, ensembles of decision trees.
4. Methods of machine learning without a teacher: dimensionality reduction, feature extraction.
5. Unsupervised machine learning methods: clustering.
6. Evaluation and improvement of the quality of the model. Cross-validation, grid search, metrics.
